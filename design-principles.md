# Design Principles

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Artificial delays** - Don't add delays "to feel more natural"
2. **Small hit targets** - If users have to aim precisely, the target is too small
3. **Blocking overlays** - Popovers/tooltips shouldn't obstruct the user's path
4. **Redundant actions** - If clicking X does Y, don't also show a "Do Y" button
5. **Layout shift** - Reserve space for dynamic content to prevent jumping
